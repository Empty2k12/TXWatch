# TXWatch

TXWatch solves a common problem in the Bitcoin world: Depending on the attached transaction fee a Bitcoin transaction can take multiple hours to be confirmed. TXWatch allows you to add these transaction ID's to a list. When any of the transactions is confirmed or included in a block, a notfication will be displayed and a sound will be played!

## Notes
Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes major parts of the app, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new feature and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit design-wise.

If you submit a PR you must accept the Contributor License Agreement. There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.
